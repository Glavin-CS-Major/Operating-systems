Operating systems
=================

Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes an operating system.

As such, computer scientists should be aware of how kernels handle system calls, paging, scheduling, context-switching, filesystems and internal resource management.

A good understanding of operating systems is secondary only to an understanding of compilers and architecture for achieving performance.

Understanding operating systems (which I would interpret liberally to include runtime systems) becomes especially important when programming an embedded system without one.

## Specific recommendations

It's important for students to get their hands dirty on a real operating system. With Linux and virtualization, this is easier than ever before.

To get a better understanding of the kernel, students could:

- print "hello world" during the boot process;
- design their own scheduler;
- modify the page-handling policy; and
- create their own filesystem.
